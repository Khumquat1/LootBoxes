    abstract = {Loot boxes are items in video games that can be paid for with real-world money and contain randomized contents. In recent years, loot boxes have become increasingly common. There is concern in the research community that similarities between loot boxes and gambling may lead to increases in problem gambling amongst gamers. A large-scale survey of gamers (n = 7,422) found evidence for a link (η2 = 0.054) between the amount that gamers spent on loot boxes and the severity of their problem gambling. This link was stronger than a link between problem gambling and buying other in-game items with real-world money (η2 = 0.004), suggesting that the gambling-like features of loot boxes are specifically responsible for the observed relationship between problem gambling and spending on loot boxes. It is unclear from this study whether buying loot boxes acts as a gateway to problem gambling, or whether spending large amounts of money on loot boxes appeals more to problem gamblers. However, in either case these results suggest that there may be good reason to regulate loot boxes in games.},

    title={The Macro Problem of Microtransactions: The Self-Regulatory Challenges of Video Game Loot Boxes},
    journal={Business Horizons, Forthcoming},
    year={2019},
    abstract={The video game industry has ignited a global controversy surrounding micro-transactions in gaming, especially the use of “loot boxes” — randomized rewards with potential real-world value. Consumers and legislators are calling for the regulation of these revenue models on the grounds that they are unfair, predatory, or types of gambling. This paper examines the controversy from a management perspective. It first considers current regulatory responses to the controversy and what they mean for business practice. It then explains ongoing industry-level and firm-level attempts to self-regulate to placate consumers and governments. These tactics highlight a wide range of broader strategies that game developers and other stakeholders can pursue to improve customer relations and more publicly signal their commitment to self-regulation and to avoiding consumer harm. Yet they can also apply more broadly than video games, especially to firms that offer controversial products or services that do not yet fit within current regulatory frameworks.},
